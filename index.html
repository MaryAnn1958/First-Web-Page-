    <p>Well, here I am, trying to learn something new! Imagine that, at my age!
        Oh well, I am enjoying it, except when I'm not. So what am I learning you ask?
        How to create a web page. So, let me tell you some of the things I have learned.</p>

    <p>I have learned that I really do like writing code. I learned that it's not at easy as one might think! I
        have learned how to create links to the web. Let me show you!

    <p style="text-align: left;">I keep forgetting to put what I want done
        <em>inside</em> the brackets! Then I just
        get frustrated. Also, I am learning CSS as well, and that uses the brackets that look like
        braces.

    <p style="color:blueviolet">I can change the color of the text in a paragraph, but I can't figure out How
        to change it within a sentence.</p>

    <p>To change the text color, it's "color: pink", with a style tag in front. So, it's style=color: pink"> but it
        doesn't
        work in the middle of a sentence. I will go research that and let you know!</p>
